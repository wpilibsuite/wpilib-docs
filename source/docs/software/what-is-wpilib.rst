WPILib is the standard software library for programming
*FIRST*\ |reg| robots.
It provides the classes and tools needed to control motors, read sensors,
communicate with the Driver Station, and run autonomous routines across
FRC\ |reg| and FTC\ |reg| via Systemcore.

WPILib is developed and maintained by a partnership between
`Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) <http://wpi.edu>`_,
FIRST\ |reg|, and volunteer developers from the community.

.. tip::

   **Java, C++, and Python use similar APIs.**
   Class names and method names are kept identical or very close across
   Java, C++, and Python.

.. rubric:: Development Environments

Write code on your computer with a **desktop editor**, or use an
**OnBot editor** in your browser. OnBot runs on Systemcore and does not
require a local editor installation.

**Desktop Environment: Java, C++, Python**

.. card:: Visual Studio Code + WPILib Extension
   :class-card: sw-card-frc

   **Desktop**

   All three languages use VS Code as the IDE, with the WPILib extension
   providing project templates, build tools, simulation, and vendor library
   management. Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

.. tip::

   **Python install experience:** WPILib is actively working to
   provide a more integrated Python setup, reducing the number of
   separate steps compared to Java/C++.
   **C++ build system:** GradleRIO is the baseline; transitioning
   to an alternative build system is possible depending on community contributions.

**OnBot Environments: Blockly, Java, Python, LabVIEW**

.. card:: VS Code-derived editor hosted on Systemcore
   :class-card: sw-card-frc

   **OnBot (Browser-based)**

   OnBot environments run entirely in the browser, no local
   installation required. Code is written, saved, and deployed directly
   on the Systemcore. Supports multiple saved Workspaces with a Deploy
   button to choose which one runs.

.. warning::

   **C++ is not supported in OnBot environments.**
   The browser-based toolchain does not provide a good enough C++ experience
   to ship. Use the desktop VS Code environment for C++ development.

   **OnBot notes:** Currently planned as single-user access
   (multi-user being investigated). Supports multiple saved
   *Workspaces* with a Deploy button to select which one runs on
   the Systemcore. Simulation is not planned for OnBot environments.

.. rubric:: Vendor Libraries

.. grid:: 1 1 2 2
   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card:: What are vendor libraries?

      Hardware vendors (REV, CTRE, etc.) ship WPILib extension
      libraries that add support for their specific motor controllers,
      sensors, and accessories. In addition, software vendors (PhotonLib, PathPlannerLib, etc.)
      ship libraries to support autonomous routines, trajectory and vision. They are installed
      **per project** via the VS Code Dependency Manager
      and do not carry over on project import.

   .. grid-item-card:: Common libraries

      - **REVLib**: SPARK MAX, SPARK Flex
      - **Phoenix 6**: Talon FX, CANcoder
      - **PathplannerLib**: auto trajectories
      - **PhotonLib**: PhotonVision cameras
      - **Limelight**: Limelight cameras

      **FRC and FTC + Systemcore**
      ^^^
      GUI tools for drawing autonomous paths. Both generate
      trajectory commands that slot into command-based robot programs.
      PathPlanner is more beginner-friendly; Choreo optimizes
      for time.

   .. grid-item-card:: Road Runner and PedroPathing

      **FTC Legacy (REV)**
      ^^^
      Libraries for generating autonomous paths and trajectories.
      RoadRunner focuses on time consistency, while Pedro Pathing
      focuses on maximizing speed.
