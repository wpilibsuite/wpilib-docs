# FIRST CAN Device Specifications

This document seeks to describe the basic functions of the current FRC\ |reg| & FTC\ |reg|
:term:`CAN` system and the requirements for any new CAN devices seeking to work
with the system.

## Addressing

FIRST CAN nodes assign arbitration IDs based on a pre-defined scheme that
breaks the ID into 5 components:

#### Device Type

This is a 5-bit value describing the type of device being addressed. A
table of currently assigned device types can be found below. If you wish
to have a new device type assigned from the ``Reserved`` pool, please
submit a request to FIRST.

============================== ==========

#### API/Message Identifier

The API or Message Identifier is a 10-bit value that identifies a
particular command or message type. These identifiers are unique for
each Manufacturer + Device Type combination (so an API identifier that
may be a "Voltage Set" for a REV Robotics Motor Controller may be a
"Status Get" for a CTR Electronics Motor Controller or ``Current Get``
for a CTR Power Distribution Module).

The Message identifier is further broken down into 2 sub-fields: the
6-bit API Class and the 4-bit API Index.

#### API Class

The API Class is a 6-bit identifier for an API grouping. Similar
messages are grouped into a single API Class. An example of the API
Classes for a CAN Motor Controller is shown in the table below.

========================= =
API Class
========================= =
Voltage Control Mode      0
Speed Control Mode        1
Voltage Compensation Mode 2
Position Control Mode     3
Current Control Mode      4
Status                    5
Periodic Status           6
Configuration             7
Ack                       8
========================= =

#### API Index

The API Index is a 4-bit identifier for a particular message within an
API Class. An example of the API Index values for a CAN Motor
Controller Speed Control API Class is shown in the table below.

=========================== ==
API Index
=========================== ==
Enable Control              0
Disable Control             1
Set Setpoint                2
P Constant                  3
I Constant                  4
D Constant                  5
Set Reference               6
Trusted Enable              7
Trusted Set No Ack          8
Trusted Set Setpoint No Ack 10
Set Setpoint No Ack         11
=========================== ==

#### Device Number

Device Number is a 6-bit quantity indicating the number of the device of
a particular type. Devices should default to device ID 0 to match other
components of the FIRST Control System. Device 0x3F may be reserved for
device specific broadcast messages.

## Protected Frames

FIRST CAN Nodes which implement actuator control capability (motor
controllers, relays, pneumatics controllers, etc.) must implement a way
to verify that the robot is enabled and that commands originate with the
main robot controller (i.e. Systemcore).

## Broadcast Messages

Broadcast messages are messages sent to all nodes by setting the device
type and manufacturer fields to 0. The API Class for broadcast messages
is 0. The currently defined broadcast messages are shown in the table
below:

================= ==
Description
================= ==
Disable	          0
System Halt	      1
System Reset      2
Device Assign     3
Device Query	  4
Heartbeat         5
Sync              6
Update            7
Firmware Version  8
Enumerate         9
System Resume     10
================= ==

Devices should disable immediately when receiving the Disable message
(arbID 0).  Implementation of other broadcast messages is optional.

## Requirements for FIRST CAN Nodes
For CAN Nodes to be accepted for use in the FIRST System, they must:

-  Communicate using Arbitration IDs which match the prescribed FIRST
   format:

   -  A valid, issued CAN Device Type (per Table 1 - CAN Device Types)
   -  A valid, issued Manufacturer ID (per Table 2 - CAN Manufacturer Codes)
   -  API Class(es) and Index(s) assigned and documented by the device manufacturer
   -  A user selectable device number if multiple units of the device type are intended to co-exist on the same network.

-  Support the minimum Broadcast message requirements as detailed in the Broadcast Messages section.
-  If controlling actuators, utilize a scheme to assure that the robot is issuing commands, is enabled, and is still present.
-  Provide software library support for C++, and Java or arrange with *FIRST*\ |reg| or FIRST's Control System Partners to provide such interfaces.

## Universal Heartbeat

Systemcore provides a universal CAN heartbeat that any device on the bus can listen and react to. This heartbeat is sent every 20 ms. The heartbeat has a full CAN ID of ``0x01011840`` (which is the NI Manufacturer ID, RobotController type, Device ID 0 and API ID ``0x061``). It is an 8 byte CAN packet with the following bitfield layout.

+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Description           | Byte | Width (bits) |
+=======================+======+==============+
| High Reserved Bits    | 7-5  | 23           |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| FTC Motor Override    | 5    | 1            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Red alliance          | 4    | 1            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Enabled               | 4    | 1            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Autonomous mode       | 4    | 1            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Test mode             | 4    | 1            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| System watchdog       | 4    | 1            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Low Reserved Bits     | 4-0  | 35           |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+

```c++
struct [[gnu::packed]] RobotState {
  uint64_t reserved_high : 23;
  uint64_t ftcMotorOverride : 1;
  uint64_t redAlliance : 1;
  uint64_t enabled : 1;
  uint64_t autonomous : 1;
  uint64_t testMode : 1;
  uint64_t systemWatchdog : 1;
  uint64_t reserved_low : 35;
}; // This definition only works on GCC linux little endian systems.
```

If the ``System watchdog`` flag is set, motor controllers are enabled. If 100 ms has passed since this packet was received, the robot program can be considered hung, and devices should act as if the robot has been disabled.

Note that all fields except ``Enabled``, ``Autonomous mode``, ``Test mode``, ``FTC Motor Override`` and ``System watchdog`` will contain invalid values until an arbitrary time after the Driver Station connects.

The ``FTC Motor Override`` flag is set when the a motor controller hardware client is allowing enablement of FTC motors without a DS connected. In this state, the robot code will be disabled.

When the bus is configured for FD, this packet is sent as a CAN FD frame with the bit rate shift enabled. This allows devices to detect if the bus has been configured for FD, and that they can safely send FD frames. If the bus is not configured for FD, this packet is sent as a standard CAN frame. The content and arbitration ID does not change between the modes.

These packets are forwarded by Motioncore to all 20 Motioncore CAN buses. The forwarded packets are always CAN 2.0.

## System Information Packets

Systemcore provides an information packet that can be used to read match state and system time. Additionally, this packet contains the bus number, which can be used to determine if buses are crossed. This information is encoded into the arbitration ID. The arbitration ID for this packet is ``0x01FF10XX`` (which is the Control System (Low Priority) ID, RobotController type, Device ID bus number and API ID ``0x100``). The bus id is encoded as the device number in the arbitration ID. This means that if vendors want to be able to read this packet on any bus, they should mask out the device ID, and treat any device ID as this packet. It is an 8 byte CAN packet with the following bitfield layout.

+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Description           | Byte | Width (bits) |
+=======================+======+==============+
| Match time (seconds)  | 7    | 8            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Match number          | 5-6  | 10           |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Replay number         | 5    | 5            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Tournament type       | 4-5  | 3            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Reserved.             | 4    | 5            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Time of day (year)    | 3    | 6            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Time of day (month)   | 2-3  | 4            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Time of day (day)     | 2    | 5            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Time of day (seconds) | 1-2  | 6            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Time of day (minutes) | 0-1  | 6            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+
| Time of day (hours)   | 0    | 5            |
+-----------------------+------+--------------+

This packet is _not_ forwarded by Motioncore to other buses. This packet is only sent on the bus that the robot controller is connected to. This means that if a vendor is expecting to need this information while connected to Motioncore, they must send it themselves from their vendor library.

This packet is sent once a second.

When the bus is configured for FD, this packet is sent as a CAN FD frame with the bit rate shift enabled. When the bus is not configured for FD, this packet is sent as a standard CAN frame. The content and arbitration ID does not change between the modes.
