# Step 1: Creating Simulated Instances of Hardware
The WPILib simulation framework contains several ``XXXSim`` classes, where ``XXX`` represents physical hardware such as encoders or gyroscopes. These simulation classes can be used to set positions and velocities (for encoders) and angles (for gyroscopes) from a model of your drivetrain. See :ref:`the Device Simulation article<docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation/device-sim:Device Simulation>` for more info about these simulation hardware classes and simulation of vendor devices.

.. note:: Simulation objects associated with a particular subsystem should live in that subsystem. An example of this is in the ``StateSpaceDriveSimulation`` ([Java](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/blob/v2024.3.2/wpilibjExamples/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/examples/statespacedifferentialdrivesimulation/subsystems/DriveSubsystem.java), [C++](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/blob/v2024.3.2/wpilibcExamples/src/main/cpp/examples/StateSpaceDifferentialDriveSimulation/cpp/subsystems/DriveSubsystem.cpp)) example.

## Simulating Encoders
The ``EncoderSim`` class allows users to set encoder positions and velocities on a given ``Encoder`` object. When running on real hardware, the ``Encoder`` class interacts with real sensors to count revolutions (and convert them to distance units automatically if configured to do so); however, in simulation there are no such measurements to make. The ``EncoderSim`` class can accept these simulated readings from a model of your drivetrain.

.. note:: It is not possible to simulate encoders that are directly connected to CAN motor controllers using WPILib classes. For more information about your specific motor controller, please read your vendor's documentation.

.. tab-set-code::
   ```java
   // These represent our regular encoder objects, which we would
   // create to use on a real robot.
   private Encoder m_leftEncoder = new Encoder(0, 1);
   private Encoder m_rightEncoder = new Encoder(2, 3);
   // These are our EncoderSim objects, which we will only use in
   // simulation. However, you do not need to comment out these
   // declarations when you are deploying code to the roboRIO.
   private EncoderSim m_leftEncoderSim = new EncoderSim(m_leftEncoder);
   private EncoderSim m_rightEncoderSim = new EncoderSim(m_rightEncoder);
   ```

   ```c++
   #include <wpi/hardware/rotation/Encoder.hpp>
   #include <frc/simulation/EncoderSim.h>
   ...
   // These represent our regular encoder objects, which we would
   // create to use on a real robot.
   wpi::Encoder m_leftEncoder{0, 1};
   wpi::Encoder m_rightEncoder{2, 3};
   // These are our EncoderSim objects, which we will only use in
   // simulation. However, you do not need to comment out these
   // declarations when you are deploying code to the roboRIO.
   wpi::sim::EncoderSim m_leftEncoderSim{m_leftEncoder};
   wpi::sim::EncoderSim m_rightEncoderSim{m_rightEncoder};
   ```

## Simulating Gyroscopes

Core WPILib no longer ships analog or SPI gyro classes (``AnalogGyro``, ``ADXRS450_Gyro``); gyro hardware is provided by vendors. The Systemcore's onboard :term:`IMU` is represented by the ``OnboardIMU`` class, and its reported values can be driven in simulation with ``OnboardIMUSim``. Unlike ``EncoderSim``, the simulation helper does not wrap a hardware object: it sets the angles, rates, and accelerations that ``OnboardIMU`` reports.

.. note:: It is not possible to simulate certain vendor gyros (i.e. Pigeon :term:`IMU` and NavX) using WPILib classes. Please read the respective vendors' documentation for information on their simulation support.

.. tab-set-code::
   ```java
   import org.wpilib.hardware.imu.OnboardIMU;
   import org.wpilib.simulation.OnboardIMUSim;

   // Create our gyro object like we would on a real robot.
   private OnboardIMU m_gyro = new OnboardIMU(OnboardIMU.MountOrientation.FLAT);
   ...
   // In simulation, set the values that the hardware object reports.
   // Like EncoderSim, this does not need to be commented out when
   // deploying code to the robot.
   OnboardIMUSim.setAngleZ(Math.toRadians(90.0));
   ```

   ```c++
   #include <numbers>
   #include <wpi/hardware/imu/OnboardIMU.hpp>
   #include <wpi/simulation/OnboardIMUSim.hpp>
   ...
   // Create our gyro object like we would on a real robot.
   wpi::OnboardIMU m_gyro{wpi::OnboardIMU::FLAT};
   // In simulation, set the values that the hardware object reports.
   // Like EncoderSim, this does not need to be commented out when
   // deploying code to the robot.
   wpi::sim::OnboardIMUSim m_gyroSim;
   m_gyroSim.SetAngleZ(wpi::units::radian_t{std::numbers::pi / 2.0});
   ```
