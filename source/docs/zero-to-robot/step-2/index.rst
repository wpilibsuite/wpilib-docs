         Step 2 of 4

**By the end of this step:** your selected programming environment will open
successfully, and the driver software required by your program will be ready
for robot setup and testing.

      - The computer you plan to use for programming
      - Administrator access if you selected desktop development
      - Internet access, or offline packages downloaded in advance

   .. grid-item-card:: FRC Driver Station Computer
      :class-card: sw-card-frc

      FRC teams also need a Windows 11 computer for the competition Driver
      Station. It may be the same computer used for programming.

Choose how you'll write code. **OnBot** runs in the browser with nothing
to install; **VS Code** is the full desktop IDE. Both are supported for FRC
and FTC with Systemcore. Keep using the environment and language you selected
on the Zero to Robot page.

.. important::

   **Some 2027 instructions are still being completed.** The FRC VS Code path
   is documented end to end. Detailed Systemcore OnBot and FTC walkthroughs
   will be added as their software is finalized. If you are using a REV
   Control Hub today, use the linked current FTC documentation instead.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: OnBot
      :sync: onbot

      OnBot runs directly in the browser, hosted on the Systemcore itself.
      There's nothing to download or install.

      **Languages:** Java, Blocks, Python, and LabVIEW.

      .. TODO: Add a screenshot of the Systemcore OnBot landing page with the editor choices labeled.

      .. note::

         **Systemcore-specific OnBot setup steps are still being written.**
         In the meantime, do not substitute current REV Control Hub connection addresses or
         deployment steps. See the `current FTC programming-tool guide
         <https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/programming_resources/shared/choosing_program_lang/choosing-program-lang.html>`_
         when using current FTC hardware.

      .. tip::

         **FRC teams:** OnBot replaces the code editor, not the Driver
         Station. You'll still need the FRC Driver Station installed
         locally for competition. See **Set Up Driver Software** below.

   .. tab-item:: VS Code
      :sync: vscode

      The WPILib installer and VS Code setup below are the same install for
      **FRC and FTC**. Where a tool or step is program-specific (like the FRC
      Driver Station or simulation), it's labeled.

      **Languages:** Java, Blocks, C++, and Python.

            Installs Visual Studio Code, WPILib extensions, and all
            desktop tools (Glass, Elastic, OutlineViewer).
            Required for Java, C++, and Python teams.

            **FRC + FTC, Python teams only**
            ^^^
            Install RobotPy and the required Python packages.
            Java and C++ teams can skip this part.

            Preparing to install without internet access?
            Download the offline installer packages in advance.

      .. rubric:: Verify Your Installation

      After completing all parts above, confirm the installation is working:

         .. grid-item-card:: Open VS Code
            :class-card: sw-card-shared

            **FRC + FTC**
            ^^^
            Launch the WPILib VS Code shortcut (not the system VS Code).
            You should see the WPILib icon (W) in the activity bar.

         .. grid-item-card:: Run WPILib Command
            :class-card: sw-card-shared

            **FRC + FTC**
            ^^^
            Press :kbd:`Ctrl+Shift+P` (or :kbd:`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
            and type *WPILib*. You should see WPILib commands in the palette.

      .. TODO: Add a screenshot showing the WPILib activity-bar icon and WPILib commands in the VS Code command palette.

      .. tip::

         **Vendor libraries are not installed here.**
         Libraries like REVLib and Phoenix 6 are added per-project in Step 4
         using the WPILib Dependency Manager. You do not need them yet.

.. rubric:: Set Up Driver Software

Your programming environment and your competition driver software are
separate choices. Set up the driver software required by your program,
regardless of whether you selected OnBot or VS Code above.

      **FRC only: Windows 11**
      ^^^
      Install this on the Windows laptop that will drive the robot at
      competition. The 2027 production release supports the official FMS.
      During pre-season testing, match alpha Driver Station builds with a
      compatible Systemcore release.

      **Coming Fall 2027 for the 2027-2028 Season**
      ^^^
      Systemcore and Motioncore use FTC-specific driver software. See the
      FTC overview for release status. Teams using the REV Control Hub today
      should continue using the current FTC Driver Station app.

.. warning::

   **Windows 10 is not supported by the FRC Driver Station beginning in
   2027.** Upgrade the FRC driver-station computer to Windows 11 before
   installing it.

      ✓ Your programming environment is ready.

   Continue when your selected editor opens successfully. FRC teams should
   also confirm that the FRC Driver Station opens; "No Robot Communication"
   is expected until the robot is configured in Step 3.
